   abstract = {Tree vigor is often used as a covariate when tree mortality is predicted from tree growth in tropical forest dynamic models, but it is rarely explicitly accounted for in a coherent modeling framework. We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests.},

Focusing on 14 species representing a potential or acknowledged commercial interest for wood production in the Guiana Shield, a joint model coupling growth and mortality for each species was parametrized, including a climatic variable related to water stress and the quantity of aboveground biomass lost after logging.

   abstract = {Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests - starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem - can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.},

   abstract = {A major challenge for forest managers is to define the optimal cutting cycle to ensure that the resource is sustained in the long term. Matrix models of forest dynamics allow time-projection of diameter-class distributions and thus assessment of the time needed, after logging, to recover a given part of the exploitable stock. They are easy to build and they only require, as input variables, the diameter structure of the population(s) under scope. However, such models are based on a coarse description of tree population dynamics and must be used with caution. In particular, as trees are only described from a diameter threshold (usually 10 cm dbh), recruitment of a new tree cannot be linked with the preceding generation since too much time elapsed between seed dispersal and the installation of a 10-cm recruit. This causes predictions of matrix models to be highly questionable in the long term when ingrowth to larger dbh classes greatly depends on the way recruitment has been modelled. We used a case study from French Guiana to test whether or not a simple matrix model is reliable enough to help forest managers choose between management alternatives. We focused on the major timber species Dicorynia guianensis Amshoff (Caesalpiniaceae) harvested under a selective cutting regime. We compared predictions of D. guianensis stock recovery in the short and long term provided by two models: StoMat, a non-regulated matrix model, and SELVA, a single-tree distance dependent model explicitly simulating the entire species life cycle. Both models were independently calibrated on data from Paracou permanent sample plots. We showed that: (i) the short-term recovery of the exploitable stock predicted by StoMat is reliable for a large range of disturbance conditions; (ii) recruitment implementation in StoMat does not influence projections until the third felling cycle; (iii) for shared initial stand conditions SELVA and StoMat give consistent mid- and long-term predictions: the simple recruitment model used into StoMat could efficiently summarise the regeneration processes of the species under low felling intensity. Our results indicate that the current felling regime used in French Guiana may not be sustainable on a long-term basis. In any case, no more than 60% of the initial stock would be recovered after logging. We conclude that simple models can provide as reliable predictions as more complicated ones. They may be sufficient to assess the recovery of a species' exploitable stock even in the long term, or at least assess the (un)sustainability of particular harvesting regimes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Information available concerning all but the most common timber species in the Guianas is scattered and difficult to obtain. Very little is known of the ecological requirements of these timber species. Over 170 tree species in Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana were found to have useable timber properties. Three-quarters of these are currently harvested in one of the three countries and less than 20% account for greater than 90% of production. Most timber species are mammal-dispersed (51%), followed by bird and wind dispersal (21 and 20%, respectively). The seeds of less than 8% of the species are transported through unassisted modes, though several of these are important timber trees. The largest seeds are associated with mammal dispersed and unassisted species. Most bird and wind dispersed species have seed sizes below the median for all timber species. The seeds of timber species in Guyana were significantly larger than non-timber species. Dispersal is important in maintaining timber tree population structures and avoiding inbreeding depression. Maintaining adequate dispersal of timber species in the Guianas depends largely on the conservation of mammals. Many species can not be dispersed by smaller animals because their seeds are too large. Wind and bird dispersed species are at a relative advantage since their seeds are smaller and can be effectively dispersed by wind and mammals in the absence of their primary agents. Available data suggest that disproportionate harvesting of mammal-dispersed species relative to their contribution to total estimated standing volumes occurs in Guyana, while bird and wind dispersed species are the most disproportionately harvested in Suriname and French Guiana, respectively. Groups of species with the same dispersal mode should be exploited in relative proportion to their availability to avoid altering resources for animals. Maintaining the widest spectrum of resources available to animals will increase the likelihood that they continue to act as effective dispersal agents of valuable timber trees in the Guianas. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {1.Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the eﬀects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0Æ25 to 6Æ47 mm year-, with an average growth of 2Æ29 mm year-1 . Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was signiﬁcantly positive for 27 species. The eﬀect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). 5. Functional traits explained 19–42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species’ response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

   abstract = {Gap phase dynamics are the dominant mode of forest turnover in tropical forests. However, gap processes are infrequently studied at the landscape scale. Airborne lidar data offer detailed information on three-dimensional forest structure, providing a means to characterize fine-scale (1 m) processes in tropical forests over large areas. Lidar-based estimates of forest structure (top down) differ from traditional field measurements (bottom up), and necessitate clear-cut definitions unencumbered by the wisdom of a field observer. We offer a new definition of a forest gap that is driven by forest dynamics and consistent with precise ranging measurements from airborne lidar data and tall, multi-layered tropical forest structure. We used 1000 ha of multi-temporal lidar data (2008, 2012) at two sites, the Tapajos National Forest and Ducke Reserve, to study gap dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon. Here, we identified dynamic gaps as contiguous areas of significant growth, that correspond to areas > 10 m2, with height <10 m. Applying the dynamic definition at both sites, we found over twice as much area in gap at Tapajos National Forest (4.8 %) as compared to Ducke Reserve (2.0 %). On average, gaps were smaller at Ducke Reserve and closed slightly more rapidly, with estimated height gains of 1.2 m y-1 versus 1.1 m y-1 at Tapajos. At the Tapajos site, height growth in gap centers was greater than the average height gain in gaps (1.3 m y-1 versus 1.1 my-1). Rates of height growth between lidar acquisitions reflect the interplay between gap edge mortality, horizontal ingrowth and gap size at the two sites. We estimated that approximately 10 % of gap area closed via horizontal ingrowth at Ducke Reserve as opposed to 6 % at Tapajos National Forest. Height loss (interpreted as repeat damage and/or mortality) and horizontal ingrowth accounted for similar proportions of gap area at Ducke Reserve (13% and 10%, respectively). At Tapajos, height loss had a much stronger signal (23 % versus 6 %) within gaps. Both sites demonstrate limited gap contagiousness defined by an increase in the likelihood of mortality in the immediate vicinity (∼6 m) of existing gaps.},

   abstract = {<p>Forest degradation is common in tropical landscapes, but estimates of the extent and duration of degradation impacts are highly uncertain. In particular, selective logging is a form of forest degradation that alters canopy structure and function, with persistent ecological impacts following forest harvest. In this study, we employed airborne laser scanning in 2012 and 2014 to estimate three-dimensional changes in the forest canopy and understory structure and aboveground biomass following reduced-impact selective logging in a site in Eastern Amazon. Also, we developed a binary classification model to distinguish intact versus logged forests. We found that canopy gap frequency was significantly higher in logged versus intact forests even after 8 years (the time span of our study). In contrast, the understory of logged areas could not be distinguished from the understory of intact forests after 6–7 years of logging activities. Measuring new gap formation between LiDAR acquisitions in 2012 and 2014, we showed rates 2 to 7 times higher in logged areas compared to intact forests. New gaps were spatially clumped with 76 to 89% of new gaps within 5 m of prior logging damage. The biomass dynamics in areas logged between the two LiDAR acquisitions was clearly detected with an average estimated loss of −4.14 ± 0.76 MgC ha−1 y−1. In areas recovering from logging prior to the first acquisition, we estimated biomass gains close to zero. Together, our findings unravel the magnitude and duration of delayed impacts of selective logging in forest structural attributes, confirm the high potential of airborne LiDAR multitemporal data to characterize forest degradation in the tropics, and present a novel approach to forest classification using LiDAR data.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2%) and high light (20%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.</p>},

   abstract = {In forest ecosystems, many functional processes are governed by local canopy gap dynamics, caused by either natural or anthropogenic factors. Quantifying the size and spatial distribution of canopy gaps enables an improved understanding and predictive modelling of multiple environmental phenomena. For instance knowledge of canopy gap dynamics can help us elucidate time-integrated effects of tree mortality, regrowth and succession rates, carbon flux patterns, species heterogeneity and three-dimensional spacing within structurally complex forest ecosystems. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has emerged as a technology that is well-suited for mapping forest canopy gaps in a wide variety of forest ecosystems and across spatial scales. New technological and algorithmic advances, including ALS remote-sensing, coupled with optimized frameworks for data processing and detection of forest canopy gaps, are allowing an enhanced understanding of forest structure and functional processes. This paper introduces ForestGapR, a cutting-edge open source r package for forest gap analysis from canopy height models derived from ALS and other remote sensing sources. The ForestGapR package offers tools to (a) automate forest canopy gap detection, (b) compute a series of gap statistics, including gap-size frequency distributions and spatial distribution, (c) map gap dynamics (when multitemporal ALS data are available) and (d) convert forest canopy gaps detected into raster or vector layers as per user requirements. As case studies, we run ForestGapR on ALS data collected over four different tropical forest regions worldwide.

   abstract = {1.Variation in forest gap size and duration are a result of spatial contiguity and continuity of gap infilling and tree mortality over time, which influences both species recruitment and successional pathways. 2.As many gaps in boreal forests are small, their size and duration will affect the conditions influencing species recruitment. We investigate the spatial dynamics of these gaps (i.e. those which are persistent, ephemeral, expanding, displaced or disappearing) and tested whether gap spatio-temporal patterns are consistent over different temporal periods (1998-2003 and 2003-2007). 3.Forest canopy gaps were reconstructed for three plots (10, 10 and 6ha in size) in southern boreal mixedwood forests around Lake Duparquet, north-western Quebec (Canada), using a time series of high-resolution canopy surface profiles from three light and ranging detection (lidar) system surveys during a 9-year window. High-resolution images were used to individually identify early and late successional gap makers. Dynamic changes in canopy gaps over a 9-year period were investigated by implementing concepts of random set theory within a temporal GIS framework. Mortality was higher on the gap edges than in the forest interior, and shade tolerant species were more likely to be gap makers than shade intolerant species. Edge trees that died causing the expansion of gaps were much smaller than trees creating new gaps. Although the overall gap size distribution was consistent over the 9years studied, the proportion of the total area opening and closing varied between periods. Independent analyses of time windows show an abundance of small gaps (below 40m 2) appearing and disappearing; however, analysis of spatial contiguity shows that the majority (over 80%) of gaps of all sizes were displaced and/or expanded. 4.Synthesis. Contrary to the previous perception that small gaps are ephemeral, which would favour the recruitment of late successional species, our findings indicate that gap displacement and expansion may be a mechanism explaining the maintenance of favourable conditions for the recruitment of shade intolerant individuals, which has been previously observed in high-latitude old-growth boreal forests. Small canopy gaps are considered ephemeral which would favour the recruitment of late successional species. Spatio-temporal analyses of a sequence of lidar canopy surfaces in high-latitude old-growth boreal forests, on the contrary indicate persistence and pervasiveness of gaps through displacement and expansion. These mechanisms may explain the previously observed maintenance of favourable conditions for the recruitment of shade intolerant individuals. © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Fine-scale height-growth response of boreal trees to canopy openings is difficult to measure from the ground, and there are important limitations in using stereophotogrammetry in defining gaps and determining individual crowns and height. However, precise knowledge on height growth response to different openings is critical for refining partial harvesting techniques. In this study, we question whether conifers and hardwoods respond equally in terms of sapling growth or lateral growth to openings. We also ask to what distance gaps affect tree growth into the forest. We use multi-temporal lidar to characterize tree/sapling height and lateral growth responses over five years to canopy openings and high resolution images to identify conifers and hardwoods. Species-class-wise height-growth patterns of trees/saplings in various neighborhood contexts were determined across a 6-km2 matrix of Canadaian boreal mixed deciduous coniferous forests. We then use statistical techniques to probe how these growth responses vary by spatial location with respect to the gap edge. Results confirm that both mechanisms of gap closure contribute to the closing of canopies at a rate of 1.2% per annum. Evidence also shows that both hardwood and conifer gap edge trees have a similar lateral growth (average of 22 cm/yr) and similar rates of height growth irrespective of their location and initial height. Height growth of all saplings, however, was strongly dependent on their position within the gap and the size of the gap. Results suggest that hardwood and softwood saplings in gaps have greatest growth rates at distances of 0.5-2 m and 1.5-4 m from the gap edge and in openings smaller than 800 m2 and 250 m2, respectively. Gap effects on the height growth of trees in the intact forest were evident up to 30 m and 20 m from gap edges for hardwood and softwood overstory trees, respectively. Our results thus suggest that foresters should consider silvicultural techniques that create many small openings in mixed coniferous deciduous boreal forests to maximize the growth response of both residual and regenerating trees. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {In much of the commercial boreal forest, dense road networks and energy corridors have been developed to access natural resources with unintended and poorly understood effects on surrounding forest structure. In this study, we compare the effects of anthropogenic and natural linear openings on surrounding forest conditions in black spruce stands (gap fraction, tree and sapling height, and density). Forest structure within a 100 m band around the edges of anthropogenic (roads and power lines), natural linear openings (streams), and a reference black spruce forest was measured by identifying individual stems and canopy gaps on recent high density airborne LiDAR canopy height models. CUSUM curves were used to assess the distance of edge influence. Forests surrounding anthropogenic openings were found to be gappier, less dense, and have smaller trees than those around natural openings. Forests were denser around natural and anthropogenic linear openings than in the reference forest with edge effects observed up to 24-75 m and 18-54 m, respectively, into the forest. A high density of saplings in the gappier forests surrounding anthropogenic openings may eventually lead to a higher forest biomass in the zone area surrounding roads as is currently observed around natural openings.},
